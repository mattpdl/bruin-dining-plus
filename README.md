## Inspiration
It's no fun going to a dining hall and being surprised or disappointed by the food.

## What it does
We made a UCLA Dining Hall Menus app with crowdsourced images and ratings.

## How we built it
We used the React Native framework with Node and Firebase as our backend.

## Challenges I ran into
None of us had significant experience with any of the technologies we used.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We all built a working app in not enough time.

## What we learned
We learned quite a bit about React Native, and dabbled with backend technologies.

## What's next for Bruin Dining+
Adding food item indicators (such as allergens and vegan options) and user comments for each rating!
